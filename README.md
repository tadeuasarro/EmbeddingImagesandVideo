# EmbeddingImagesandVideo
First Microverse project | Youtube Copy | Special Attention to branching and pull requesting

This is Enrique and Tadeu's first Microverse project which consists of a basic HTML copy of a Youtube page.
The main objective of this project is to work the basics of HTML and CSS, embedding images and video to our web page.
The page structure consists of a <header> and one main <section>. This <section> consists of two different <div> one being the container and the other being the sidebar.

We hope you enjoy it.
